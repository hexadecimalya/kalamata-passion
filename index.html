        Greece with its Mediterranean climate is the perfect home of the olive
        tree. Local and regional climatic differences and soil conditions have
        led to ever new varieties of olives in Greece. That is why there are
        many varieties of Greek olives today.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are now over 60 different types of olives. Each variety has its
        own character. The olive varieties in Greece differ not only in size,
        color and shape, but also in the composition of their ingredients and
        thus in taste.

        Kalamata olives are almond shape and have a brown deep purple color.
        They are found on the Peloponnese peninsula in southern Greece and have
        played a role in human nutrition for thousands of years. The olive trees
        grow under the amazing Greek sun and have much larger leaves than other
        types of olive trees around the nation and the world. The fruits of this
        variety are called Kalamata olives only if they actually come from the
        region, as it is a protected designation of origin.
